# IoT-People-Counter
This repository contains the source code for the IoT People Counter project.

FONTS:
Content uses 2 non-standard fonts: Raleway (https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Raleway) and Foundation Icon Fonts (http://zurb.com/playground/foundation-icon-fonts-3)
To pick up the fonts in BIRT Designer Pro add the TTF files from each font type to your system fonts (Raleway-Regular.ttf, foundation_icons.ttf)
iHub deployment: /home/skynet/BIRTiHubVisualization/modules/BIRTiHub/iHub/web/iportal/iportal/common/webfonts
~Added all font files, as well as dependant files from Google for Raleway.
~Edited webfonts.css to suppress the default "Old Style" version of Raleway (Old Style introduces oddly sized numbers that are different heights)
